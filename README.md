## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Polished](https://polished.js.org/) - Styling toolset
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Package bundler
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - JS Linter
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - CSS Linter

### What I learned

This was my first time building anything with React and Styled Components. In process of building this project I got familiar with React and Styled Components. I also re-learned some things about CSS transitions and animations.

### Continued development

I like how easy it is to separate and use the styles. At first it was confusing but after spending some time I got used to it. I think React and Styled Components are great frontend tools and I'm looking forward to building some complex projects with them.
